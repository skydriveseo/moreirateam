			<p>Cash out refinances should only be used when the borrower is planning on moving and will have to sell their home at some point in the future. If you're planning on staying in your home for years, or if it's not an urgent matter for selling your property, then taking out a second mortgage isn't necessary.</p>
			<p>When you refinance your home with a cash out refinance, you can receive extra cash from your mortgage lender. You may be tempted to take out a second mortgage for this reason. Many people think they can use a cash-out refinance to save money on their mortgage.</p>
			<p>However, there are some things you must know before you take this step. Here are some popular cash out refinancing mistakes to avoid:</p>
			<ol>
			<li><strong>I.  Not understanding the interest rate on your current loan</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Before you go through with a cash out refinance requirements, understand how much interest you will pay on the new loan and what it will cost to make the switch. If your current interest rate is 3% and your new rate is 2%, for example, then you'll be paying $200 in extra interest every year. The total amount of interest that you'll pay over the life of the loan could be hundreds or even thousands of dollars more than what your old loan would have cost!</p>
			<ol start="2">
			<li><strong>II. Not knowing how much equity will be left after refinancing</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you do decide to make a cash out refinance, be sure that there is enough equity in your property (i.e., after all, costs) to cover the entire balance on your existing mortgage. In case, you drain too much equity on your home, even more than its worth, then it might put you at risk. It also might put you in a challenging role if you want to refinance your home in the future.</p>
			<ol start="3">
			<li><strong>III. Not considering the cost of repaying the amount</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Find out how much money you can afford to pay on your current mortgage and the amount of your debt. Then, compare that to what you would need to put down on a new loan. You can use sites like Bankrate or Lending Tree to find out what kind of loan you need and how much money you can afford to pay on it.</p>
			<ol start="4">
			<li><strong>IV. Find out where your interest rate will be going up or down, if at all.</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Many lenders will offer different rates for fixed-rate loans and variable-rate loans, so make sure that you understand exactly what type of loan you're getting into before signing on the dotted line!</p>
			<ol start="5">
			<li><strong>V. Ensure that there are no pre-set limits for your loan with the lenders</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>Make sure that there are no pre-set limits in place on how fast you can get approved for a cash out rates from your lender (sometimes called "balloon payments"). These are typically set at six months or less for most home purchases, but could be as low as 30 days for some borrowers who have been in good standing with their lenders for years - so make sure that you are on good terms with your lenders.</p>
			<ol start="6">
			<li><strong>VI. Going for it without having your finances in good condition</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you are not having a stable income as of now and neither have a low debt-to-income ratio, then it is not imperative to apply for a mortgage loan. So, ensure that your finances are in good shape before you apply for it. Also, try to maintain good cash out refinance credit score so that a lower mortgage loan can be approved by lenders.</p>
			<ol start="7">
			<li><strong>VII. Unable to compare the cost between different lenders</strong></li>
			</ol>
			<p>With so many new online lenders like <a href="https://moreirateam.com/">Moreira</a>, customers nowadays have got plenty of options in their hands to get a mortgage loan from the lenders of their choice. Though one can opt for a loan from credit unions or from traditional banks, you can even get quotes from various mortgage providers out there to get the perfect deal on your <a href="https://moreirateam.com/mortgage-products/cash-out-refinance/">cash out loans</a>. Some even get a quick and secure pre-approval online loan, without affecting any credit.</p>
			<p>So, a cash-out refinancing would be a great option if you avoid the mistakes discussed above. But ensure to have smart plans for the money beforehand and make sure that it does not dares to end up all your equity as it might put you at high risk!</p>
